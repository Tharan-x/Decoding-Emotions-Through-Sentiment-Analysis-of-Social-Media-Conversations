🚀 DECODING EMOTIONS THROUGH SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF SOCIAL MEDIA CONVERSATIONS

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to decode emotional signals from social media conversations. By analyzing public posts from platforms like Twitter, Reddit, or other forums, the system identifies whether the sentiment expressed is Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

The core engine uses the VADER Sentiment Analyzer, with added capabilities such as:

Preprocessing unstructured text data

Emotion classification

Visualizing emotion distribution

Generating a project workflow flowchart
